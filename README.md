# Jerrys-revenge
Jerry is tired of constantly having to hide. But they love you. They give you food, water, and shelter. Don't they Tom? 
While you live conformably, Jerry has to steal food to survive. And guess who tries to stop him? That's right. It's you Tom.

Jerry is fed up.
He's been building his mouse army for years, waiting for this moment.
Sure, you can take on one mouse, but what about hundreds?

This isn't the classic cat and mouse chase that you're used to Tom.

This is much worse.
